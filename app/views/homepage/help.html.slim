      h3.govuk-heading-s What is the ePER?

      p The ePER is a part-digital version of the Person Escort Record. It is currently being piloted at a number of prisons in England.

      h3.govuk-heading-s How is it different from the paper PER?

      p You complete the ePER on our online service, which:

      ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
        li uses information from NOMIS to automatically complete some details
        li remembers and reuses answers from previous PERs
        li highlights important risk and healthcare information for escort staff

      h3.govuk-heading-s What should it be used for?

      p The ePER should be used for all court journeys, inter-prison transfers and hospital journeys from your establishment.

      h3.govuk-heading-s Is it all done online?

      p Not yet. The ePER replaces the first two pages of the paper PER (front cover and risk indicator).

      p You'll complete the following sections on our online service:

      ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
        li Prisoner details
        li Move details
        li Offences
        li Risk
        li Healthcare

      p Once complete, you can print off the ePER and staple it to the 'Escort handover details' booklet.
